# QApp

QApp is a repo which can be cloned to quickly create a non-production dotnet core/vuejs application
with a database, http api and staticly hosted files (which a reverse proxy can point to for SSL), user login/management, and a
reasonable architecture for doing server side work. The point of which is to eliminate all the time typically spent on boilerplate
code when you have an idea and want to get it online.

Again, this is not meant for a serious internet facing websites. This is meant for local intranet, or personal internet facing websites
without any valuable payload.
